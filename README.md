Bitty Arcade - Extremely Retro, Minimalist, Handheld Arcade Game.
=================================================================

This is my remix of an Arduino based handheld arcade game using an 8x8 LED
matrix as display.

The original inspiration and idea comes from [3CarrotsOnAStick] and is heavily
based on his [AbHhGd] - Arduino Based Hand-held Gaming Device instructable. Most
of the code and game ideas come from here, but I have had to make some heavy
code changes to compile in my environment as well as some changes that I wanted
to the code.

This device also uses the potentiometer as controler, while other devices like
this often uses 4 directional buttons. I decided to stick with the pot for now,
but this may change later.

For now the project is not completed yet, but I have a custom case designed and
it is printing now as I type, and I'm working on the code to allow rotation of
the display in 90° increments. I need this since for my case I had to rotate the
display by 90°, and I also want to clean up the display handling in the original
code which needs the sprites and coordinates to be mirrored.

I'll update here as the project progresses.
